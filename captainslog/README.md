##Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

-- The code works, I believe. At least it works on Chrome and Firefox. I do not own a copy of IE and so I have not tested it on IE. Firefox, however, handles local storage in a unique way that I do not know how to counter. It seems to have something to do with the fact that in Firefox, keys for local storage include the clear(), removeItem(), setItem(), getItem(),and key() functions. This means that the way I access the locally stored data also grabs these functions and prints them. Why this happens is mystifying....


##Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

Ming and I talked for a while about the above issue, but are still unclear on the solution. Otherwise, I pretty much did it myself with some starting help from a TA.


##Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

4 hours approx
