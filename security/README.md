###Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.###


I think I've correctly implemented everything. I was trying to add alt tags to the images to make them easier to identify, but for some reason that wasn't working. Everything else seems like its in place though.


###Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.###


I did this mostly bymyself (with my partner's code of course), but I was initially guided by a conversation Ming had with his students on the couches by the stairs in Halligan. It did give me my inital ideas on what to try and what might be interesting.


###Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.###


6 hours about. (most of which was researching issues, and listeining to conversations with Ming about the assignment.)


###Be written in either text format (thus README.txt) or in Markdown (thus README.md). No other formats will be accepted.###

Of course!
