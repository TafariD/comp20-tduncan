## Lab 6, as done by
# Tafari Duncan

    The assignment was completed successfully, although it was not submitted until 1 day after the assignment's original due date.

    The assignment was done with some limited assitance from Thomas Colgrove and Alice Lee. 

    Approximately 2 hours were spent on the assignment.


    ## is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?  ##

    NO, it's not possible. As discussed in class with the Facebook/Bank of America example, there are lots of security concerns regarding the ability to request data from different origins/local machines. It didn't work when tried during the lab, and it shouldn't work in order to help keep data private and in the hands of the companies/people it belongs to.
