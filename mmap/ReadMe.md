    ##Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

    Now, I'm pretty sure everything was implemented correctly. The only thing is that there is a "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input" error that appears in the Javascript console. It is supposedly related to line 1 of the index file, but everything works and I'm not sure why the error is there.

    ##Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

    I was assited by Jason Fan and Ben Battle in some conceptual understanding, but most of my help came from TAs and studying/borrowing Ming's code as well as code from Google. I believe I cited where code is borrowed.

    ##Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

    I spent approximately 2 weeks completing this specific assignment. I suffered a number of issues, initally due to my misunderstanding a few key assignment concepts (namely the way the HTTP requests worked, but also how to structure the code in the javascript file) that caused setbacks, and then I was unable to work on the assignment over break when my computer crashed. I completed the assignment on March 23rd, 2015, with the help of TAs.
